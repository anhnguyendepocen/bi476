## Exercises

1. Use R to draw the density curve of $X \sim N(0, 5)$ and $Y \sim N(2, 5)$, and mark the type I 
	error $\alpha=0.05$ and the corresponding Type II error $\beta$.
2. A randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed drug to 
reduce pain in patients after joint replacement surgery by comparing with the standard care. 100 
patients were assigned to receive either the new drug or the standard care. The primary outcome 
was a reduction of 3 or 3+ scale points (clinically meaningful reduction). The data are summarized 
in the following table:

| Treatment | $n$ | \#patients with 3+ reduction | proportion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New drug | 50 | 23 | 0.46 |
| Stanard care | 50 | 11 | 0.22 |
 
- How would you analyze the data for this superiority design? Write down the R code.

3. A small randomized clinical trial was conducted to test whether treatment $A$ (new drug) was 
effective in lowering DBP as compared to $B$ (standard) and to describe changes in DBP across times 
at which it was measured (`DBP.dat`).
- Are the baseline (DBP1) and the potential confounding factors balanced in these two groups? How to 
analyze? Write down the R code and also the results and conclusion.
- Is the treatment $A$ more effective in lowering the DBP than $B$? Use the parametric methods, 
	adjusted by the confounders.
- Can you analyze the data using the nonparametric methods?



4. Bioequivalence, crossover clinical trial
In this exercise we will use a dataset from a bioequivalence clinical trial described in Chow and Liu 
(2009). The trial utilized a standard two-sequence (i.e., 1=RT and 2=TR), two-period, two-formulation 
(T=Test; R=Reference) (i.e., $2 \times 2 \times 2$) crossover design to compare two oral formulations 
of a drug, and was conducted with 26 healthy volunteers (subjects). Subjects were randomized to either 
five 50mg tablets (T) or 5 mL of a suspension (R) at the first period baseline, and then crossed over 
to the alternative formulation at the second period baseline. And the bioavailability outcome is the 
area under the concentration-by-time curve (AUC) over the interval from 0 to 48 hours. The data file 
is `ChowLiu2009data.csv`. 
- Write an R code to compute the area under the concentration-by-time curve (AUC):
$$
AUC = \sum_{\tau=1}^k \frac{(c_{\tau}+c_{\tau-1})\times (t_{\tau} - t_{\tau-1})}{2}
$$
where $t_{\tau}$ is the $\tau$-th time point of blood sample collection and $c_{\tau}$ is the 
$\tau$-th blood or plasma concentration and $\tau=0,1,2,\dots,k$.
- Test for the carryover effect
  * Compute the subject totals across two periods:

  $$
U_{ik} = Y_{i1k} + Y_{i2k}
  $$
  where
    - $k=1,2$: the sequence
    - $i=1,\dots,n_k$: the subject in each sequence $k$
    - $Y_{ijk}$: the AUC for subject $i$ in sequence $k$ and period $j$.
  * Calculate the sample mean across all the subjects in each sequence:
$$
\bar{U}_{*k} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} U_{ik}, k=1,2
$$
  * Compute the differential carryover effect $C$:

$$
\hat{C} = \bar{U}_{*2} - \bar{U}_{*1}
$$
  * $\hat{C}$ is normally distributed with mean $C$ and variance:

$$
\widehat{Var}(\hat{C}) = \hat{\sigma}_u^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})
$$
  and

$$
\hat{\sigma}_u^2 = \frac{1}{n_1+n_2-2}\sum_{k=1}^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} (U_{ik} - \bar{U}_{*k})^2
$$
  * Compute the statistic:
$$
T = \frac{\hat{C}}{\sqrt{\widehat{Var}(\hat{C})}} \sim t(n_1 + n_2 - 2)
$$
  * Compute the $p$-value, and draw the conclusion.

- Test for direct formulation effect:
  * Compute the difference in periods for each subject within each sequence:
  $$
d_{ik} = \frac{1}{2}(Y_{i2k} - Y_{i1k}), i=1,\dots,n_k; k=1,2
  $$
  * Compute the sample means for the period differences for each sequence:
  $$
\bar{d}_{*k} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} d_{ik}
  $$
  * Compute the direct differential formulation effect:
  $$
\hat{F} = \bar{d}_{*1} - \bar{d}_{*2}
  $$
  * If no carryover effect, $\hat{F} \sim N(F, \widehat{Var}(\hat{F}))$, where
    - $\widehat{Var}(\hat{F}) = \hat{\sigma}_d^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})$
    - $\hat{\sigma}_d^2 = \frac{1}{n_1+n_2-2} \sum_{k=1}^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n_k}(d_{ik} - \bar{d}_{*k})^2$
  * Similarly, compute the $t$-statistic:
  $$
T_F = \frac{\hat{F}}{\sqrt{\widehat{Var}(\hat{F})}}
  $$
  * Compute the $p$-value and reach the conclusion.

- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
```
Data <- data.frame(subj = as.factor(dat$subj),
		formu = as.factor(dat$formulation),
		seq = as.factor(dat$seq),
		prd = as.factor(dat$prd),
		auc = dat$auc)

summary(aov(auc ~ seq*formu + Error(subj), data=Data))
```

- Two one-sided t-test

FDA has specified a decision criterion for concluding bioequivalence of a test formulation (T) to a 
reference formulation (R): T is bioequivalent to R if the 90\%CI on the ratio of the mean of T to the 
mean of R is between 80\% and 125\% for bioequivalent outcome AUC.
  * Compute the mean AUC for each formulation
  * Determine the decision CI $(\theta_L, \theta_R)$ for the difference in means calculated using 
	the mean of the reference formulation (R).
  * Use two one-sided t-test to validate the bioequivalence of the two formulations.
  $$
\begin{aligned}
T_L = \frac{\bar{Y}_T - \bar{Y}_R - \theta_L}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_d^2 (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}}\\\\
T_U = \frac{\bar{Y}_T - \bar{Y}_R - \theta_U}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_d^2 (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}}
\end{aligned}
  $$
