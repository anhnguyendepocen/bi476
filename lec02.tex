\section{Some important concepts and notions}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Measures of Disease Frequency}
A fundamental task in medical studies is to quantify or measure the \alert{occurrence of 
a disease in a population}. Obtaining a measure of the disease occurrence is one of the 
first step in understand the disease of interest.
\begin{description}[<+->]
	\item[\alert{Ratios}]{$\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is NOT part of $b$}
	\item[\alert{Proportions}]{$\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is INCLUDED in $b$}
	\item[\alert{Rates}]{$\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is the number of affected in a given time 
		interval, while $b$ is the population at risk over the same interval.}
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Prevalence}
$$
\textrm{Prevalence} = \frac{\mbox{\#cases observed at time } t}{\mbox{\#individuals at time} t}
$$
\begin{itemize}
	\item An outbreak of diarrhea on a cruise ship in a day.
	\item 8 persons out of 86 on the ship are exhibiting signs of diarrhea.
	\item The prevalence of diarrhea at this particular time is $8/86=0.092$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Incidence}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cumulative incidence rate (CIR)
	$$
\textrm{CIR} = \frac{\mbox{\#newly disease cases in a time interval}}{\mbox{\#individuals-at-risk}}
	$$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the cruise ship example
		\item 12 persons developed diarrhoeal disease after 5 days of the outbreak.
		\item The indicidence rate was therefore $12/86=0.14$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Incidence density rate (IDR)
	$$
\textrm{IDR} = \frac{\mbox{\#individuals of newly disease}}{\mbox{total time for all disease-free individuals-at-risk}}
	$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Outcome and Exposure}
A good research statement of a medical problem is often simple, considering one 
exposure and one outcome variable (e.g. organic solvents and brain tumor).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Primary outcome
	\item Secondary outcome
\end{itemize}

Research questions ask about the associations between exposures and outcomes. 
\begin{quote}
Is proximity of the residents to the coke-works site associated with hospital 
admission of children for repiratory problems?
\end{quote}

A hypothesis is then formulated to predict the result.
\begin{quote}
The risk of hospital admission for respiratory problems for children increases 
with proximity to the coke-works site.
\end{quote} 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Analytic Design Strategies}
\begin{block}{Observational Studies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Case-control; cohort
	\item Exposures are self-selected;
	\item we simply observe exposed or not;
	\item whether they develop the outcome or not.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Intervention Studies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Randomized controlled trials
	\item Exposures are allocated by investigators (not self-selected)
	\item Closest to a laboratory experiment;
	\item Basis of evidence-based recommendations;
	\item Required by regulatory bodies.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Ecological Fallacy}
\framesubtitle{Higher fat intake causes breast cancer?}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{../images/ecological_fallacies.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Ecological fallacy is an error in reasoning, usually based on 
		mistaken assumptions. 
	\item<2-> The ecological fallacy occurs when you \alert{make conclusions about 
		individuals based only on analyses of group data}. 
	\item<3-> In this fat intake example, we do not know individuals having 
		breast cancer were actually consumed high amount of fat.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Case Reports}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Case Report: Example}
{\large \alert{Haemorrhagic-fever-like changes and normal chest radiograph in a doctor with SARS.}\\
\small{Wu E., et al. Lancet 2013; 361(9368): 1520-1521.}}

This case report is written by the patient, a physician who contracted SARS, 
and his colleague who treated him, during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. 
They describe how the disease progressed in Dr. Wu and based on Dr. Wu’s case, 
advised that a chest CT showed hidden pneumonic changes and facilitate a rapid 
diagnosis.

{\large \alert{Kaposi's sarcoma in homosexual men-a report of eight cases.}}\\
\small{Hymes KB. et al. Lancet 1981; 2(8247): 598-600.}

This case report was published by eight physicians in New York city who had 
unexpectedly seen eight male patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Prior to this, 
KS was very rare in the U.S. and occurred primarily in the lower extremities of 
older patients. These cases were decades younger, had generalized KS, and a much 
lower rate of survival. This was before the discovery of HIV or the use of the 
term AIDS and this case report was one of the first published items about AIDS 
patients.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Case Report: Definition}
Case report is an article that describes and interprets an individual case, often 
written in the form of a detailed story.

Case reports often describe:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unique cases that cannot be explained by known diseases or syndromes
	\item Cases that show an important variation of a disease or condition
	\item Cases that show unexpected events that may yield new or useful information
	\item Cases in which one patient has two or more unexpected diseases or disorders
	\item the \alert{lowest-level} of evidence, but also the \alert{first-line} evidence.
\end{itemize}

A good case report will be clear about the importance of the observation being reported.

If multiple case reports show something similar, the next step might be a case-control 
study to determine if there is a relationship between the relevant variables.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Case Report: Pros and Cons}
\uncover<1->{\begin{alertblock}{\center Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Help the identification of new trends or diseases;
	\item Help detect new drug side effects and potential uses (adverse or beneficial)
	\item Educational - a way of sharing lessons learned
	\item Identifies rare manifestations of a disease
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}}
\uncover<2->{\begin{alertblock}{\center Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cases may not be generalizable
	\item Not based on systmatic studies
	\item Causes or associations may have other explanations (confounding)
	\item Can be seen as emphasizing the bizarre or focusing on misleading elements.

the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and severity of disease course in 
14 patients with bullous pemphigoid.

\section{Cross-sectional study}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Cross-sectional Studies: Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A cross-sectional study explores the disease and risk factor 
		patterns in a representive part of the population, in a 
		narrowly defined time period.
	\item Primarily, this study provides information on \alert{prevalence} 
		of disease and risk factors.
	\item It also can seek associations, generate and test hypotheses. And, 
		by repetition, cross-sectional study can be used to measure 
		changes.
	\item Ideal cross-sectional study is of a geographically-defined, 
		representative sample of the population within a slice of 
		time and space.    
\end{itemize}

\section{Case-control study}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Case-Control Studies: Definition}
An epidemiological study in which a group of persons with the disease 
of interest (\alert{case}) and a group of persons with similar features 
to the case group but without the disease (\alert{control}) are selected 
to compare the proportion of persons exposed to a risk factor of interest 
(\alert{exposure}) in order to elucidate the causal relationship of the 
risk factor of interest and the disease.

From \textbf{case series}, \textbf{personal experience}, and \textbf{others stuffs},
\begin{itemize}
	\item Almost 99\% of patients suffered from condition $Y$ had a 
		history/evidence of exposure to $X$.
	\item What is the problem in this case study?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It will never prove a causal relationship due to lack of 
			control group.
	\end{itemize}
	\item It will generate a hypothesis testable using epidemiological methods:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Persons with disease $Y$ were more likely to have been exposed 
			to factor $X$ comparing to persons without the disease, but 
			similar in other aspects.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
That's the case-control study, a retrospective, observational study.

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Case-Control Studies Problems}
\framesubtitle{Bias and confounding}
In case-control studies, the inferred association can be introduced by the 
subject selection process, the problem of data collection, and/or the other 
factor(s) that are related to both exposure and the outcome under study.

Only when the two concerns - \alert{bias and confounding} are addressed, the 
causality relationship can be derived.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Bias}
\begin{description}
	\item[Bias]{Any systematic error in the \underline{design/subject recruitment}, 
		\underline{data collection}, and/or \underline{data analysis} that 
		results in a mistaken estimation of the true exposure-outcome association.}
	\item[Selection Bias]{Error due to systematic differences in characteristics 
		between those selected/non-selected into a study; or systematic differences 
		in which cases and controls, exposed and non-exposed subjects are selected 
		so that distorted association is observed.}
\end{description}
\uncover<1->{\begin{exampleblock}{Smoking-AMI Association}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If hospitalized cases of AMI are selected as cases, and heavy/long-term smokers are more 
likely to die outside of hospital (massive MI), the smoking-MI association would be 
underestimated.

	\item If hospitalized AMI and hostpitalized non-MI patients are selected as cases and controls, 
and smokers are more likely to be hospitalized for other condition (e.g. pulmonary), the 
smoking-AMI association would be underestimated.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Selection Bias}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exposure has influence on the process of case assessment: the 
		exposure prevalence in cases is biased.
	\item Exposure has influence on the process of control selection: the 
		exposure prevalence in controls is biased (e.g. use chronic 
		bronchitis patients as controls for study of smoking and CHD, 
		smoking and LC.)
	\item \alert{Selective survival} and \alert{selective migration}: the 
		exposure prevalence in prevalent cases may be biased compared 
		to incident cases. 
\end{itemize}
\uncover<2->{\begin{alertblock}{Case-control association is valid only when}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cases are selected as \alert{representative sample} of all people 
		with such disease.
	\item Controls are selected as a representive sample of all people 
		without the disease in the same population as cases.

		of outcome, exposures, and covariates.}
\end{description}
\uncover<2->{\begin{exampleblock}{Example}
\begin{description}
	\item[recall bias]{Lung cancer cases are more likely to recall their smoking 
		history (quantitatively or qualitatively), which will lead to over-estimation 
		of smoking-cancer relationship.}
	\item[missing bias]{Overweighed persons are more likely to have missing data in 
		untrasound examination of carotid arteries.}
	\item[report bias]{Females are more likely to under-report of their weight, and males 
		over-report.}
\end{description}
\end{exampleblock}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Confounders (Confounding)}
\alert{Confounding} is a situation in which a measure of the association between 
exposure and outcome is distorted because of the relationship between the exposure 
and the other factor (the confounder) that influences the outcome under study.

Confounding is the most important concept because it impacts the \textbf{validity} 
of an observational study.

\uncover<2->{\begin{alertblock}{Factor $X$ is a confounder only if it meets the 3 criteria}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is an risk factor of the outcome under study, independent of the risk 
		factor under study.
	\item It is associated with the exposure under study.
	\item It is not in the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome.

\frametitle{Cohort study： Pros and cons}
\begin{block}{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accurate exposure
	\item Subjects in cohorts can be matched, limiting the influence of confounders.
	\item Temporal relationship: short-term or long-term outcome
	\item Multiple outcomes: cerebral dysfunction, myocardial infarction, etc.
	\item Very rich study design, but it is diffcult and often act as the second step.
	\item Easier and chpeaper than an RCTs.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cohorts can be difficult to identify due to confounders.
	\item No randomization leads to imbalance in patient features.
	\item Blinding/masking is difficult.
	\item More difficulties related to both costs and feasibility because of the 
		longitudinal follow-ups
	\item Different lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) rates for healthier and diseased groups
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Limitations of Observational Studies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Patients who receive on-pump or off-pump CABG may differ in many ways 
		besides their type of surgery that could be related to the outcome under 
		study (confounding).
	\item In observational studies, on- vs. off-pump CABG was related to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item extent and location of heart disease
		\item obesity
		\item chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
		\item experience of practitioner with off-pump
		\item etc.
	\end{itemize}
	\item These differences could explain differences in rates of endpoints such 
		as mortality or complications seen in observational studies between on- vs. 
		off-pump patients.
	\item We can control for known confounders through univariate stratification, 
		or multivariate analysis (MVA), but we can't control for unknown, unmeasured, 
		or unmeasurable differences.
	\item The amount of uncontrolled bias and confounding could be as large as the 
		effect under assessment.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Propensity score}
\framesubtitle{A method to minimize the confounding in observational studies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In RCTs, the proper randomization provides a \alert{balanced distribution} of both observed 
		and unobserved factors between different study arms, which \alert{minimize confounding}.
	\item Observational studies often suffer because such balance cannot be met.
	\item Multivariate regression can provide adjusted estimate for the main exposure by 
		including the confounders in a model.
	\item However, when more than the allowable number of covariates need to be adjusted, we 
		may need to consider dimensionality reduction.
	\item Propensity score adjustment is a method of control for potential confounders for the 
		association between a pre-specified exposure and outcome, which provides a \alert{
		quasi-RCT} setting for observational data analysis. 
\end{itemize}
The propensity score analysis works by creating a single score estimate on the probability to 
exposure, which is used to control for many potential confounders at once without a loss of 
analytical power, is considered the most aggressive adjustment for measured confounders.
